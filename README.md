Turret Force

# Introduction

We had a requirement back in the day to create a chat server. Got the inspiration to create a multiplayer game out of the original chat server code I had.
This is in no way am I confident that it's coded in good standards since I was still a student back in the day. 
I'm planning to turn this in a better game given my experience now. 
I was damn decent in creating pixel art. I should do something with this.
Since I was feeling nostalgic, I'm planning to actually make this into a simple full pledge game and decided to share it publicly in my newly formed github.
Hopefully I can take it a little further and make this available online. 
This is to inspire would be software engineers someday. You gotta have to start somewhere

# The Game

1. You are in a post apocalyptic world.
2. Rockets are attacking your home base.
3. You and a friend should protect your home base with the use of a dual turret. 
4. Shoot rockets.
5. Do not let one pass you.

# Setup
Simply install java. 
Compile the main code TurretForce.java.
Run the game using javac TurretForce.

# Known Issues
I remember that different computer capabilities, different fps. I haven't gotten into that bug yet. 
I'm sure I can solve it once I have the time from all this adulting.
